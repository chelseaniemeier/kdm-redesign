# kdm-redesign

Project title:
Redesign of the Kentucky Derby Museum website

Motivation:
The purpose of my project was to redesign the Kentucky Derby Museum website to make it more visually pleasing and easier to navigate. The current and live Kentucky Derby Musuem website (DerbyMuseum.org) is very visually overwhelming and limited in its design capabilities. As the Museum's current Senior Graphic Designer and website manager, there are so many things I've wanted to change up but couldn't because of lack of knowledge in coding, and because the original web developing agency built a very basic CMS backend framework that stripped away any chance to change the css or other files. Which leads to why I chose to work on this for my Code Louisville Capstone Project.

Build status:
Please note that my redesign project picked only a few pages to redesign. There are many more subpages to create which I will continue to develop even after the due date of November 17, 2017 for this FEWD session of Code Louisville. Eventually I will redo every page and hopefully in the future do a complete transition so that my redesign becomes the actual site for the Kentucky Derby Museum.

Technology used:
I used html, css, & javascript/jquery.

Features:
I used Javascript in three places: 1) the toggle hamburger menu in the top right, 2) the e-newsletter signup located in the footer [if the user tries to submit, but leaves the input area blank, a hint appears that says to enter the email address, and it will disappear again once clicked in the field input field], and 3) the google map on the contact.html page. 

Installation:
All you need to do is download the kdm-redesign repository to your computer, where it will include on the files you needs for it to run properly. Once downloaded, open index.html on your desired browser.

Be aware of live external links:
In my redesign project, there are a couple places where I link to actual live links to the Museum's ticket sale site/store site. I did not build those sites, but included them to give my redesign a better flow so that my "shop online" and "purchase tickets" buttons went somewhere instead of not opening anything. For example, for my "shop online" links, I linked to the live https://derbymuseumstore.com/ page.
